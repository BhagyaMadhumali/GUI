Hospital Appointment System: 
This application streamlines hospital appointment management for patients and staff. The backend, built with Node.js or C#, integrates with MySQL or PostgreSQL for data storage, while the patient-facing frontend uses React for an interactive experience. Hospital staff will manage operations via a C# desktop app with Windows Forms or WPF. A secure login system with role-based access ensures data protection, enabling efficient CRUD operations for appointments, schedules, and patient profiles.
